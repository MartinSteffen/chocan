** Abstract: Chocaholics Anonymous


The repository collects the /sources/ of the ``chocan'' (Chocaholics
Anonymous) project in the software programming lab course about ``practical
software engineering'' (not ``prgramming-in-the-many''), summer 2001.

See also the  [[http://heim.ifi.uio.no/msteffen/teaching/softtech/ss01/projektpraktikum/][course web pages]].





** Historical notes

The repository has been resurrected by migrating ig from ~cvs~ via svn
(using ~cvs2svn~) and from there to ~git~. Caveats concerning missing
branches apply.  Also, original /authors/ have not been preserved, as the
original development was done all via ``anonoymous'' logins; in general,
the contributors were the different students in the course plus the course
teachers.
